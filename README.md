# About Me
## My Interests 
I enjoy playing video games with my friends, ever since I was a child it has always been something I do. When I am not playing video games I am either hanging out with my girlfriends or my friends. I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, I have recently gotten back into
anime, which I am pleased about because I used to watch it all the time but stopped because I didn't have as much free time to do so.
## Website I Recommend
- Crunchyroll (https://www.crunchyroll.com/) I use this website a lot to watch my shows
- YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/) YouTube has been very helpful with helping me in my classes when I am confused and they have lots of entertaining content as well
- Xbox Cloud Gaming (https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play) This website is cool because it lets you play Xbox games you own anywhere even on your phone, it isn't something I use much cause I'm never on the go but good to know!
